sf-ip-fw extension provides several building blocks to build your
own firewall solution, based on raw iptables.

These building blocks currently are used by custom non-public
firewalling solutions made by Fajne.IT for its customers, but this
extension is intended to change this in the future, by providing
a complete, multi-functional firewall implementation in a publicly
available extension.
